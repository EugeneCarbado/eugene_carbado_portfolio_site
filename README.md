## My process

For my process I used SCSS and HTML purley to demonstrate my skills with flexbox and
SVG's. I used Javascript for the nav menu when the website is viewed on mobile. I also used wepback to bundle my code. I used a moble first workflow then added the media qieries for tablet and desktop.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SVG's
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- Webpack for bundling

### What I learned

I learnt a lot of about using svg's in a project in terms of resizing. Also how they can cause problems with pushing elements out if being reszied as the z-index was not working. I could apply better properties to achieve my desired results but am satified that I was able to use them. I also had some more exposure to flexbox which I feel very comfoortable using. I did not use any grid but feel I could have to really maximise the result I was going for. Using SCSS also I felt I understood more what it was doing and how I can use easier syntax in terms of mixin's. 

### Continued development

I want to further develop my skills with SCSS in terms of grid as I feel they will really benefit me going forward in my career.

### Useful resources
